time (these " **Terms** "). If you are accessing or using our Platform as a representative of an organisation, you are agreeing to these Terms on
their behalf. Desmos Labs and users are referred to as "parties" in these Terms.

## Our Platform

DPM is a Web3 mobile wallet offered by Desmos Labs that interacts with the Desmos blockchain, as well as other supported blockchains
including but not limited to Cosmos-based blockchains (e.g. Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, Juno, Crypto.org, etc.), EVM-based blockchains (e.g.
Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, etc.), Solana, and others.

DPM does not collect your personal data (such as your email address or your mobile phone number) when you create your Desmos profile,
or when you use or interact with the platform. You are completely free in submitting any information about yourself. Please refer to our
Privacy Policy for details on how we handle any personal data we receive from you.

Each profile created with DPM is only accessible by you. We don’t have access nor we can delete your profile or take control over it, in any
way.

Any data or transaction history that DPM features performs is stored only on the Desmos Blockchain. We, Desmos Labs and our officers

modified.

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between the parties, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or
records with respect to the subject matter hereof.

If any provision of these Terms becomes invalid or unenforceable, it will be deemed modified (to the minimum extent necessary) to make it
valid and enforceable, or where such modification is not possible, deemed deleted and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the


remaining provisions.

The failure of either party at any time to insist on the performance of, or to exercise a right or remedy under, any provision of these Terms is
not a waiver of its right at any later time to insist on the performance of, or exercise a right or remedy under, that or any other provision of
these Terms.

personality). A reference to "writing" or "written" includes fax, e-mail and instant messaging. A reference to one gender will include a
