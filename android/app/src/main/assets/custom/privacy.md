# Privacy Policy for DPM (Desmos Profile Manager)

This Privacy Policy explains how DPM (Desmos Profile Manager) (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and protects the information collected through our mobile application.

## Information Collection and Use:

DPM is a Web3 mobile wallet that interacts with the Desmos chain, as well as other supported chains including but not limited to Cosmos-based chains (e.g. Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, Juno, Crypto.org, etc.), EVM-based chains (e.g. Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, etc.), Solana, and others. Our application does not collect any personal information from users. The only information stored on the device is the private keys of the wallets generated or imported by the users. This information is encrypted using either a password chosen by the user or biometric information enrolled on the device.

## Firebase Notifications:

In the future, we may use Firebase to handle in-app notifications for our users. Firebase may collect certain information from our users, including device information, unique identifiers, and interaction data. This information will only be used to provide and improve our notification services and will not be shared with any third parties. By using our application, you consent to the collection and use of your information by Firebase for these purposes.

## Third-Party Services:

Our application does not use any third-party services that collect data, except for Firebase for in-app notifications, as described above. We do not share any information collected with any third parties.

## Data Retention:

The encrypted private keys of the wallets generated or imported by the users are stored only on the device of the user and are not stored in any centralized or online service. The private keys will be deleted from the device upon the deletion of the application.

## Security:

We take security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These measures include encryption of the private keys and secure storage on the device. However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy:

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or services. We will notify you of any material changes to this policy by posting the updated policy on our website or through our application. Your continued use of our application after any changes to this policy will constitute your acceptance of such changes.
