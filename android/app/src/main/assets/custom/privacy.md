3. In the future, we may use Firebase to handle in-app notifications for our users. Firebase may collect certain information from our users,

**NOTE:** Due to the immutable, permanent and transparent nature of blockchain protocols and applications, you must carefully consider what
information you choose to publish about yourself (through the creation of the Profile) or share with others, since you may not be able to
erase, remove or delete it, nor control who has access to it.

trade union membership, genetics, biometrics, health, or sexual orientation.

We **do not knowingly collect** or use personal data from minors.

including for the purposes of fulfilling any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.
* The encrypted private keys of the wallets generated or imported by the users are stored only on the device of the user and are not
stored in any centralized or online service. The private keys will be deleted from the device upon the deletion of the application.

However, due to the immutable, permanent and transparent nature of blockchain protocols and applications, we are unable to erase,
remove or delete your information recorded on-chain, or any files that have been posted to the InterPlanetary File System or similar
decentralised storage systems even after the retention period has expired.

## Security and transfer of your personal data

We employ a number of technical and organisational measures to safeguard the security of the personal information we collect or store on
your device. These measures include encryption of the private keys and secure storage on the device. However, no method of transmission
over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Within Desmos Labs, access to your personal information is restricted to personnel or service providers on a strictly need-to-know basis.

We collect personal information globally. We may transfer, process and store your personal information outside your country of residence,
and the parties with whom we share your personal information may operate in a country outside your country of residence.

Some of the countries in which the parties with whom we share your personal information operate may not have the privacy and data
protection laws that are equivalent to those in your country of residence. When we share information with these parties, we use our best
endeavours (such as by entering into contractual terms) to safeguard the security of the information transferred.

material changes to this policy by posting the updated policy on our website or through our application.
